# ModelDemo

## Introduction

The purpose of this code base is to provide a basic example of how you use Property Wrappers in SwiftUI to pass data between components. This is not a complicated example or a through one, but what it does to is expose two examples of hwo to pass data around. The first is using a Model and inversion of control. The second is by using bindings that allow you to pass a mutable object into components which are struct and so therefore should be "immutable".
